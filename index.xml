      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there. Setting up your dev environment was meant to be a single command away. And yet, here you are, hours later, just on the cusp of victory, before it turns out that you&amp;rsquo;re missing yet another API key. You know you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but you DM your teammate, let&amp;rsquo;s call her Fatima, asking her to please send you the credentials. You&amp;rsquo;ll clean up after yourself, deleting the message as soon as you add the credentials to your environment configuration.</description>

      <description>Hi there. My name is Okal Otieno. I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer with product experience spanning financial services, data collection and visualisation, messaging, and EdTech. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in roles ranging from hands-on development, and architecture, to engineering management. Even the odd bit of UI/UX design in a past life. I currently work as a Tech Lead at JUMO, a financial services technology company.
This blog is a catalogue of the joys, frustrations, and - hopefully - brief moments of insight that come with my work.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Python Static Analysis</title>

      <description>I had an opportunity, in mid-2017, to work on tooling to weed out dead code from one of the codebases I work on at Jumo¹. We use an in-house framework for building USSD² applications, the main mode of interaction users have with our lending platform.
There isn’t much of a FOSS USSD ecosystem, so the framework had to solve a lot of basic problems in novel ways. Some of the most interesting aspects of it have to do with session management - USSD being a stateless protocol without any widely adopted session management standards, and a metaclass³ based routing model.</description>
