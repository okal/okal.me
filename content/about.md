Hi there. My name is Okal Otieno. I'm a software developer with product
experience spanning financial services, data collection and visualisation,
messaging, and EdTech. I've worked in roles ranging from hands-on development,
and architecture, to engineering management. Even the odd bit of UI/UX design in a
past life. I currently work as a Tech Lead at [JUMO](https://jumo.world), a financial
services technology company.

This blog is a catalogue of the joys, frustrations, and - hopefully - brief
moments of insight that come with my work. I'll also share bits and pieces of
my life and interests outside of work every so often. Thanks for reading!
